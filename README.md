# Descripción:
README must describe the code and application files, and how your program should be run.

# Página Web:
An important piece of your final project is a public web site that describes all the great work you did for your project. The web site serves as the final project report, and needs to describe your complete project.

1. Description of problem.
2. Description of the need for Big Data.
3. Description of the solution and comparison with existing work on the problem.
4. Description of the data: where did it come from, how did you acquire it, what does it mean, etc.
5. Technical description of the application, programming models, platform and infrastructure.
6. Links to the repository with source code, evaluation data sets and test cases.
7. Technical description of the software design, code baseline, dependencies, how to use the code, and system and environment needed to reproduce your tests.
8. Performance evaluation (speed-up) and discussion about overheads and optimizations done.
9. Description of advanced features like models/platforms not explained in class, advanced functions of modules, techniques to mitigate overheads, challenging implementation aspects...
10. Final discussion about goals achieved, improvements suggested, lessons learnt, future work, interesting insights… and any needed reference.
Your web page should include screenshots of your software that demonstrate how it functions.
